SEY:

Excellent.

Meaning you don't fly anywhere
near him.

The drug dogs smelled cocaine
on his plane.

He's a playboy, a dilettante.

Your dogs could sniff cocaine
on half the jets at le Bourget.

His jet is the only one that
had 100 kilos of pure heroin.

Which was stolen.

The street value is 350 million.

We've been tracking the Prince
for months.

You're a fantasist.

Seven if you count
the two at the hospital.

Yes, in the projects.
